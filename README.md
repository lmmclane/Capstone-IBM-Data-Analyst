# Capstone-IBM-Data-Analyst
Project Overview
Welcome to my Capstone Project! This project focuses on analyzing emerging programming skills in demand through data collected from various sources including job postings, training portals, and surveys. Posing as a (future) Data Analyst, I will utilize web scraping techniques and APIs to gather data in formats like .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.

Modules Overview
Module 1: Data Collection
Objective: Collect data using web scraping and APIs from job postings, training portals, and surveys.
Module 2: Data Cleaning
Objective: Clean the dataset by identifying duplicate rows, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.
Module 3: Data Analysis
Objective: Analyze the cleaned dataset to understand data distribution, identify outliers, and explore correlations between different columns.
Module 4: Data Visualization
Objective: Create visualizations using developer survey data to depict data distribution, relationships, composition, and comparisons.
Module 5: Dashboard Creation
Objective: Build a dashboard using Google Looker Studio to present the data intuitively, allowing for easy exploration and drill-down of insights.
Module 6: Storytelling Presentation
Objective: Craft a compelling narrative that communicates my analysis findings clearly and effectively.
Evaluation
Throughout the project, my progress will be evaluated through quizzes in each module and your final presentation.
